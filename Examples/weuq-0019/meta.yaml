summary: "This example demonstrated a workflow for evaluating wind loads on building components and cladding. The target structure used in this example is a simple single family low-rise building with gable roof. For computing component and cladding loads, the workflow uses a transient CFD simulation. The example defines the design wind speed is as random variable and the related uncertainties are propagated thought the workflow to computed final wind loads"
