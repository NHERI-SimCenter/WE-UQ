+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This example uses the Digital Twin capability implemented in WE-UQ Version 3.2.0. It demonstrates the procedure for calibrating Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) flows using large eddy simulation in an empty domain configuration. For creating the CFD model, the inputs are taken from a wind tunnel experiment conducted at the boundary layer wind tunnel of Tokyo Polytechnic University (TPU). The cross-section dimensions of the CFD model are set to match the wind tunnel dimensions in the test section. :numref:`fig-we15-dmn` shows the extent of the computational domain with dimensions. Fetch distance measures the distance between the inlet anticipated location of the structure. At this location, the characteristics of the approaching wind will be examined. This example is developed based on the works of [Chew2024]_ and [Melaku2024]_. Detailed instructions to set up the CFD model can be found in the documentation of :ref:`Empty Domain CFD Simulation <lblEmptyDomainCFD>`.

Start
^^^^^^^
First, open the workflow by selecting **Tools -> CFD - Empty Domain Simulation** from the menu bar. Then, load the JSON setup file using **LOAD File** button. The JSON file can be found :github:`here <Examples/weuq-0015/src/input.json>`. Once the JSON file is loaded, in the *Start* tab, change the **Path** to your preferred directory by clicking the **Browse** button as shown in :numref:`fig-we15-start`. Leave the remaining settings to their default values. 

   .. note::
      If the **Path** field does not automatically change when the JSON path is loaded, you can manually copy and paste your working directory path into the field. 

.. _fig-we15-start:

   Setup the path to the working directory in the *Start* tab of the workflow.


Domain Dimensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Since the CFD simulation is run at a reduced scale, change the **Geometric Scale** (:math:`\lambda_L`) to 1:400 as given in :numref:`tbl-we15-1`. In the text, you need to put only 400. Set the length (:math:`L_x` ), width(:math:`L_y` ) and height (:math:`L_z` ) of the computational to 5.2 m, 2.2 m, 1.8 m, respectively, as shown in :numref:`fig-we15-geom`. For the **Fetch Length (X-axis)** specify 2.1 m.

.. _fig-we15-geom:

   :width: 80%

   Set the dimensions of the computational domain in the *Geometry* tab.  


Mesh Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The mesh is generated by first creating a background grid. Make a uniformly spaced background mesh by specifying **No. of Cells** in x, y and z directions to 52, 44 and 36. Then, generate the background mesh by clicking the **Run Background Mesh** button. Next, in the *Regional Refinements* subtab define local refinements. For this example, we create three refinement boxes shown in :numref:`fig-we15-mesh`. The refinement regions are created by providing the min and max coordinates of the bounding boxes. Then, the final mesh is generated by clicking the **Run Final Mesh** button. This will automatically update the mesh visualization window on the right panel. 

.. _fig-we15-mesh:

   :width: 100%

   Define meshing controls and generate the grid in the *Mesh* tab.  


Boundary Conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Set the fields in *Wind characteristics* group based on the values provided in :numref:`tbl-we15-1`. Set the **Velocity Scale** (:math:`\lambda_V`) to 4, **Reference Wind Speed** (:math:`U_{ref}`) to 10.69 m/s, **Reference Height** (:math:`H_{ref}`) to 0.3 m and **Roughness Lenght** (:math:`z_0`) in full-scale to 0.5 m. For the boundary conditions, use the *TInf* option at the inlet of the domain. For the ground surface, use *roughWallFunction* and set up the boundary conditions on the remaining surfaces as seen in :numref:`fig-we15-bc`.  

If *TInf* is used for the inlet, specify the turbulence generation scheme in the *Inflow Generation* group. For this example, use *DFM* which represents the Digital Filtering Method. To specify the target wind profiles, click **Import(*.csv)** and locate the ``*.csv`` file you download from :github:`here <Examples/weuq-0015/src/target_wind_profiles.json>`.  

.. _fig-we15-bc:

   :align: center
   :alt: Image showing error in description
   :width: 75%

   Setup wind characteristics with the boundary conditions in the *Boundary Conditions* tab.  


Numerical Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Set the turbulence modeling, solver type, duration and time step options in the *Numerical Setup* tab. For the **Simulation Type** use *LES* and select *dynamicKEqn* for the **Sub-grid Scale Model**. Set the **Solver Type** to *pimpleFoam* with 1 **Number of Non-Orthogonal Correctors** , 2 **Number of Corrector Loops** and 1 **Number of Outer Corrector Loops**. Set the maximum Courant number to 1.0 and select the **Adjustable** time step. 

For the **Duration** of the simulation, use :math:`37 s` based on what is specified in :numref:`tbl-we15-1`. This time step translates to :math:`3700s` in full scale with a time scale of 1:100, which is a little over the recommended 1 hour duration. The **Time Steep** can be calculated automatically from the smallest mesh size by clicking **Calculate** button. For this example, the calculated time step is :math:`0.000736624 s`, which is changed to a conservative value of :math:`0.005 s`. Finally, check the **Run Simulation in Parallel** option and put 56 for the **Number of Processors**.

   Edit inputs in *Numerical Setup* tab


Set Results to Monitor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the *Monitoring* tab, specify simulation results to be recorded as seen in :numref:`fig-we15-mon`. For this example, we will monitor both the velocity and pressure distribution at selected places in the computational domain. Firstly, check the **Record Wind Profiles** checkbox. Then, add three line probes (profiles) by clicking **Add Profile** and edit details as shown in the figure below. For example, *Profile1* is located at the inlet and measures the characteristics of flow velocity. *Profile2* is located downstream and measures the incident flow (i.e., the wind the structure will experience) on a vertical line. Whereas, *Profile3* measures the downstream evolution of the pressure fluctuation in the stream-wise direction. Also, specify the **Field Write Interval** to 10 and **Write Start Time** to 1.      
 
To monitor the snapshot of the flow field, check **Sample Flow Field** and add two section planes for monitoring the velocity field. Edit the table entries as seen in :numref:`fig-we15-mon`. *Plane1* is a vertical plane normal to the y-axis and monitors the snapshot of the velocity field from 1 s to 3 s.  *Plane2* is a horizontal plane normal to the z-axis and monitors the snapshot of the velocity field from 1 s to 3 s. The files for both planes will be written every 50 time steps (i.e :math:`50 \times 0.0005 = 0.025 s`) as specified in **Flow Write Interval**.

   Specify results to record in the *Monitoring* tab


Run the Simulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
First, in the main WE-UQ window login to *DesignSafe* with your credentials. Then, in the CFD workflow window, submit the simulation by clicking **RUN at DesignSafe**. Then, provide the simulation a **Job Name**. Set **Num Nodes** to 1 and **# Processes Per Node** to 56 with a **Max Run Time** of  *12:00:00*. Finally, click the **Submit** button to send the model to *DesignSafe*.  

.. figure:: figures/we15_run_job.svg
   :align: center
   :alt: Image showing error in description
   :width: 30%

   Submit the simulation.


Show Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After submitting the simulation, you can check the status of the remote job by clicking **GET from DesignSafe**. Once the remote job is finished, the results can be reloaded by selecting **Retrieve Data** after right-clicking on the job name. This will automatically download the CFD results and activate the *Results* tab. In this tab, we can examine the characteristics of the flow in different ways, e.g., plot wind profiles, velocity spectra, and pressure fluctuation as seen :numref:`fig-we15-res` . 

.. _fig-we15-res:

.. figure:: figures/we15_results_tab.svg
   :align: center
   :alt: Image showing error in description
   :width: 75%

   Show the post-processed outputs in the *Results*.


Wind Profiles
""""""""""""""
In the *Monitoring* tab, we specified two line probes for monitoring the velocity profile at the inlet and incident location. To plot these profiles under **Wind Profile** select **Name of the Profile** as *Profile1* and click **Plot Profile** button. For example, :numref:`fig-we15-res-prof` shows the velocity profiles at the inlet which include mean velocity, turbulence intensity and length scale profiles. In this plot, the dotted black lines show the target profiles, while the red solid lines with o are the results from the CFD.

   Comparison of the wind profiles from the CFD at the inlet with the target values


Velocity Spectra
"""""""""""""""""
Similarly, the velocity spectra at different heights can be shown by clicking **Plot Spectra**. For instance, :numref:`fig-we15-res-spec` shows the reduced velocity spectra at :math:`H_{ref}` for the three components of the velocity. Also, the figure compares the spectra from the CFD (red solid line) with the target von Kármán model (black dotted lines).

   Comparison of the velocity spectra from CFD with von Kármán at inlet.


Pressure Fluctuation
"""""""""""""""""""""
To examine the downstream evolution of the pressure field, select *Profile1* for the profile name and plot pressure distribution. :numref:`fig-we15-res-prs` shows the standard deviation of the pressure on the ground surface. The x-axis shows the distance from the inlet of the domain. Using turbulent inflow at the inlet often introduces artificial pressure fluctuation at the inlet. However, this fluctuation decays as the flow progresses downstream as shown in :numref:`fig-we15-res-prs`.

   Evolution of pressure fluctuation downstream of the inlet.


Wind Field Visualization
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
Furthermore, the full simulation data can be found in ``Documents/WE-UQ/RemoteWorkDir/results`` folder. This directory contains the OpenFOAM case files with all ``*.log`` files showing the outputs from each step in the simulation. The user can visualize this data locally using Paraview. After launching Paraview, open **File -> Open** and locate the path ``Documents/WE-UQ/RemoteWorkDir/results/``. Then, open the file ``vis.foam`` and load the simulation results to Paraview. The following figure shows a sample visualization of the developing turbulent flow structure in the domain.

To visualize *Plane1* defined in *Monitoring* tab, load ``Documents/WE-UQ/RemoteWorkDir/results/Plane1_renamed/Velocity_T*.vtk`` files to Paraview and create the visualization. The following two videos for *Plane1* and *Plane2* are created from VTK samples saved during the simulations.
