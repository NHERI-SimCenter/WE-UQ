summary: "This example illustrates an advanced application of the CFD workflow. It demonstrates application of the workflow to any urban area by generating building footprints, creating computational meshes with refined regions, and setting realistic wind conditions to run a full-scale CFD simulation. It shows how users can define regions of interest, automate geometry and mesh generation, and post-process results to evaluate wind profiles and velocity fields, providing a practical template for applying the WE-UQ and BRAILS++ workflow to real community-scale wind studies."
